# bluegreen and argocd
Create a file named `app.py` in the `src` directory with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Your Dockerfile already looks good and should work without any errors. Here's the complete Dockerfile for reference:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY src/app.py .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

To build and run the Docker container, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
docker build -t simple-python-app .
docker run --rm simple-python-app
```

This will print "Hello, World!" to the console.

joelwembo: can you give me a simple websever python 

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a simple Python web server using Flask. Update your app.py file with the following content:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

You will also need to update your Dockerfile to install Flask. Here is the updated Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py .

RUN pip install flask

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

To build and run the Docker container, use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
docker build -t simple-python-webserver .
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 simple-python-webserver
```

This will start a simple web server that you can access at `http://localhost:5000`, and it will display "Hello, World!" in your browser.

joelwembo: customize the Dockerfile to avoid errors

GitHub Copilot: Your Dockerfile looks mostly correct. However, to ensure it is error-free and follows best practices, you can add a few improvements:

1. Use a specific version of Flask to avoid potential future compatibility issues.
2. Add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker build context.

Here is the updated Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py .

RUN pip install flask==2.0.3

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

And here is the `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:

```dockerignore
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env
venv
ENV
.git
.gitignore
```

To build and run the Docker container, use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
docker build -t simple-python-webserver .
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 simple-python-webserver
```

This will start a simple web server that you can access at `http://localhost:5000`, and it will display "Hello, World!" in your browser.

joelwembo: change the image to joelwembo/argocd_blue_green_demo

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here is the updated Dockerfile with the specified image name:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py .

RUN pip install flask==2.0.3

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

To build and tag the Docker image with the specified name, use the following command:

```sh
docker build -t joelwembo/argocd_blue_green_demo .
```

To run the Docker container, use:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 joelwembo/argocd_blue_green_demo
```

This will start the web server, and you can access it at `http://localhost:5000`.

joelwembo: in app.py add index.html and endpoint for default instead of hello  world, you can include the html inside the app.py

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can serve an HTML page directly from your Flask application. Here is the updated app.py with an HTML page included:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return '''
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Welcome</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the simple Python web server.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    '''

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

This will serve an HTML page with a "Hello, World!" message and a welcome paragraph when you access the root endpoint (`/`).

joelwembo: add error handling if flask not there ? 

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can add error handling to check if Flask is installed and provide a meaningful error message if it is not. Here is the updated app.py:

```python
try:
    from flask import Flask
except ImportError:
    print("Flask is not installed. Please install it by running 'pip install flask'")
    exit(1)

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return '''
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Welcome</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the simple Python web server.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    '''

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

This code will check if Flask is installed and print an error message if it is not, then exit the program. If Flask is installed, it will run the web server as before.

joelwembo: check the Dockerfile and we need to add tags :latest , only add commands commented

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here is the updated Dockerfile with the commented commands to include the `:latest` tag:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py .

RUN pip install flask

CMD ["python", "app.py"]

# docker build -t joelwembo/argocd_blue_green_demo:latest .
# docker push joelwembo/argocd_blue_green_demo:latest
# docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 joelwembo/argocd_blue_green_demo:latest
```

These commands will build, push, and run the Docker image with the `:latest` tag.
